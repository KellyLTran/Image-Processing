# Image-Processing

Functionality:
The program reads data from binary .tga files and writes the processed data back into .tga files, maintaining the binary format.
The program uses a command-line interface, which allow users to specify which image manipulation tasks they want to perform.
The program comes with a Makefile for users to easily compile and run the application without interacting with complex build settings.

Program Structure:
The program allows reading and creation of custom .tga files using C++.
The program comprehends RGB format for color representation, using three numbers (ranging from 0-255) to depict the red, green, and blue proportions in the color.
The program supports operations like Multiply, Screen, Subtract, Addition, and Overlay on image data.
